    <h2>STEP 2: <span class="highlight">Build Your Public Narrative</span></h2>
    <p>Crafting your public narrative allows you to share your story—whether in a group setting or a one-on-one conversation. 
    While you may not always have time to tell your full story, you should find ways to weave elements of it into your presentation naturally.</p>

    <button class="accordion">📖 The Three Parts of a Public Narrative</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><strong>Public narrative is a powerful framework that helps leaders communicate their values and inspire action. It consists of three key parts:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Story of Self:</strong> Why are you called to do this work? What personal experiences led you to care about voter registration in healthcare?</li>
            <li><strong>Story of Us:</strong> What values and experiences does your audience share? How does your story connect to the broader healthcare community?</li>
            <li><strong>Story of Now:</strong> What urgent challenge threatens these values? What action must we take together?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">💡 Key Tips for Crafting Your Narrative</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Scars, Not Wounds –</strong> Choose a story you are ready to share with colleagues. It should reflect growth and lessons learned, rather than an experience that still feels unresolved.</li>
            <li> <strong>Rooted in Values –</strong> Identify a core value (or a mix of values) that truly represents who you are and why this work matters to you.</li>
            <li> <strong>Keep the Focus on You –</strong> A common mistake is centering your story on others. While other people may be part of your journey, your audience wants to know who you are and what drives you.</li>
            <li> <strong>Make Them Feel –</strong> The most impactful stories evoke emotion. Be brave and vulnerable (within your comfort level) to help your audience connect with your experience.</li>
            <li> <strong>Paint the Picture –</strong> If you have the time to share a full narrative, use sensory and emotive language to make your audience feel like they were there with you.</li>
        </ul>
